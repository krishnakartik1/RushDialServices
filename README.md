1. This is a simplistic take on *Just Dial* that was done as the final project for grade 12 CBSE. 
2. This service allows one to register with the project and allows the registered user to access various features like viewing the restaurants in the nearby locality ,having them arranged by type ,price and rating, viewing shopping centres in the local area based on what you want to purchase such as apparel or something else sorting it based on what you wish to sort it on. 
3. This also allows you to view the local cinemaâ€™s and see what movies are available and allowing you to book seats for the film using a user friendly interface, which will then take you to the credit screen to pay for your seats, the project gives you bonus points based on the purchases made in the cinema bookings which you can use for premium offers. It also allows you to view your profile and edit information for your profile.
